<h1> PRS CARRIERS </h1>
<p> <h3> If you ask anyone in the age group of 20 and 60 years, the very word, ‘leisure’ is a fleeting concept.<br/>
In the race to meet the endless series of deadlines, we indeed have no time to stop. But there’s one group of people
whose job is to make you stop and stare and then purchase, no matter how pressed for time you are.<br/>

In the older times, their methods would be more overt and often intrusive and we’d sniggeringly call them, ‘salespersons’.<br/>
These days they work their way in a much more suave and subtle manner and we call them, ‘marketers’. Several of the highest
paying jobs in India in marketing have helped people from the marketing field lead a luxurious and comfortable life <br/>
for themselves.</h3> </p>
